
Shibatch Super Equalizer ver 0.03 for winamp
written by Naoki Shibata  shibatch@users.sourceforge.net

Shibatch Super Equalizer is a graphic and parametric equalizer plugin
for winamp. This plugin uses 16383th order FIR filter with FFT algorithm.
It's equalization is very precise. Equalization setting can be done
for each channel separately.

Processes of internal equalizer in winamp are actually done by each
input plugin, so the results may differ for each input plugin.
With this plugin, this problem can be avoided.

This plugin is optimized for processors which have cache equal to or
greater than 128k bytes(16383*2*sizeof(float) = 128k). This plugin
won't work efficiently with K6 series processors(buy Athlon!!!).

Do not forget pressing "preview" button after changing setting.
